				"description": "The Premium Annual Membership plan offers 90 minutes of 'free' ride time a day, and members will have their choice of free bike helmet, courtesy of Idaho Power, or a custom Boise GreenBike stainless steel growler, while supplies last.\r\nFor all rides over 90 minutes users will be charged at a rate of $4 per hour, which is prorated based on the actual amount of time the bike is in use.\r\nNew this for 2016, Boise GreenBike is removing the $2 Out of Hub fee for locking a bike away from a station hub for Premium members. As long as the bike is eventually returned to a station hub you never have to worry about the $2 fee again. We are doing this on a trail basis and reserve the right to rescind this offer if it becomes difficult to manage the system.\r\nAll memberships renew automatically unless the member goes to their account page and turns off auto-renew.\r\nOverage charges of $4/hour apply over the 90 minutes of ride time you get each day.\r\n"
