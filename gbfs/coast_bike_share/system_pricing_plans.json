Once you sign up for a Pay As You Go plan, you're charged the amount you selected plus tax which will be deposited as credit into your account. You will then be charged the amount you designated any time your account goes below $1.00\r\n\r\nMore frequent riders may want to get an Annual Membership, which will give you 60 minutes of time per day for just $79 per year!\r\n"
